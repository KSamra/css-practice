# Description
A landing page for a fictional company named Natours. The main goal of this project was to practice CSS techniques involving the Float positioning method and the various solutions needed to fix common problems that tend to arise in this paradigm such as 'clearfix'. The page is also responsive and was designed so using a 'Desktop-First' approach. 

Original design of this layout was made by Jonas Schmedtmann for the udemy course ['Advanced CSS and Sass'](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/)
